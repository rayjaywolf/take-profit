# No Comments Rule

NEVER add any comments to code. This includes:

- Single line comments (`//`)
- Multi-line comments (`/* */`)
- JSDoc comments (`/** */`)
- HTML comments (`<!-- -->`)
- CSS comments (`/* */`)
- Any form of code documentation comments

Write clean, self-documenting code without any comments whatsoever.
